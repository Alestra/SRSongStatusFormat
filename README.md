# SRSongStatusFormat
Code to support stylizing the Song Status Output file to a standalone HTML page for use in overlays.

## Directions
1. Copy files (songstatus & songstatus.html) directly to your Synth Riders install location:
    Typically: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SynthRiders
    
That's it.

_If you are changing the page styling and you would like to test your work without loading the game to play just copy the SongStatusOutput.png and SongStatusOutput.txt to the same directory. 

## Future Enhancements
1. Standardize stylizing to allow easier customization.
2. Build easier interface for testing
